# answers-lie-in-the-past

In Answers Lie in the Past, the player travels back in time to the same room five years ago.. 

(For example in the current time the door might be blocked but if you go back to the past the door is clear).

When the player travels through time, the player will be in the same position that they currently are in leading to some cool puzzle design.

Genre: 2D puzzle game.
